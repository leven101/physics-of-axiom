 - have to use words to define the word "word". But since the definition of integers is recursively hierarchical there are multiple problems with it. (1) the only existing set of one is the definition of 0 and (2) as defining the word "word" as "the combination of the 23rd, 15th, 18th and 4th letters of the alphabet".
